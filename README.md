## Classification of German Trafic Signs

This project uses a convolutional neural network to classify german traffic signs. This is necessary for self driving cars so they can identify the traffic on the road such as "STOP". 
The model can be trained and run on a PC (it may take a few minutes), then tested with images from the internet. To run the program you will need to import Tensorflow, then in the terminal
run "python3 main.py". First you will prompted to train the model. Then you can test the model against images from the web.
